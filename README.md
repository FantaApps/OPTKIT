OPTKIT is a tool kit that can be used to do optimization works & large scale graph analytics  
  
The major function it implements are:  
  
1) Best first search (Parallel version)  
2) Lin-Kernighan heuristics (Parallel version)  
3) Graph K-truss decomposition  
  
Algorithm implemented are:  
1) Knapsack  
2) Maximum Clique  
3) DCJ distance/median  
4) K-truss decomposition

INSTALL  

Before install you need to make sure that you have installed:  

autoconf  
automake 
libtool (in MAC system, it's glibtool)  
glog  
gnu g++-4.8
gtest -- when build with MAC os, you need to be very careful to build gtest the same compiler with this project.  

./init.sh
